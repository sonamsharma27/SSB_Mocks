    <p style={{marginLeft: '2rem'}}>Thematic Appreciation Test (TAT) is a projective method of assessing personality, which is considered the best method as it reveals a personâ€™s innate personality by responding to some pictures or situations.</p>

    <h2 style={{marginLeft: '2rem'}}>About the Test:</h2>
    <p style={{marginLeft: '2rem'}}>TIn the Thematic Appreciation Test (TAT) of the SSB Interview, 11 hazy pictures/sketches or unstructured slides are shown to the candidate in quick succession. Each Slide is held to view only for 30 seconds. The candidate is then given 4 minutes to develop and write a story on what they saw and perceived in the picture. The lights remain switched off while the slide is being shown, when half a minute is over, they again come on.

    The Last Slide or 12th Slide is left blank, in which you have to write any story which comes to your mind.
    
    The test looks similar to that of the Picture Perception and Description Test (PPDT), which is conducted at the Screen-in Stage at SSB Interview, but both are different in many ways.
